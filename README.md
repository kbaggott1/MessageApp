# MessageApp

## Goal
Our goal was to create an easy to use, intuitive and web-based messaging application.
We wanted to offer users the same service across all hardware, preventing cross-platform
issues all too familiar to so many people around the world today. We seek to offer secure
and safe registration and login/logour services, using hashing to ensure the safety of our
users information.

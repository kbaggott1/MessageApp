        <p className="description">Our message service began as an idea in theminds of three bright computer scientists 
        studying at John Abbott College. All three of 
        our founders (pictures on the left) 
        had lived their whole lives using 
        messaging services and had almost felt like 
        the many flaws of these platforms were 
        simply fact. That was until they decided to fix 
        the problems they saw with the instant 
        messaging apps they used themselves. They 
        got together and worked tirelessly to create 
        something better and solve the issues so 
        prevalent in the instant messaging domain.  
        As computer scientists, we have have the right
        knowledge to provide solutions to these issues.
        Our app is different in the sense 
        that it provides an interface
        that is easy to understand for the average user.
        We decided to make our app very visual, with buttons
        that are pretty self explanatory about what they do 
        once the user presses on them just by looking at them.
        Therefore, it is great for people of any age due to its ease of use, 
        especially the elderly, who often have difficulty with technology.  
        So, if you want an application that is easy to use for everyone 
        and has a great looking user interface...
